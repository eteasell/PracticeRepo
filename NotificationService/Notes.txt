Project Notes

If we want to make a notification service, we will need to connect to a DB cloud service to store 'subscribers', 
meaning in the simple case webhooks.

So we post a webhook subscription, so that 'messages/notifications' received to the API can forward them to the webhook.

I guess the simple option is to just make an API request containing the webhook and the 'notification' and this API just posts it.

Does that even count as a notification service then? What am I actually doing?

How do I manage my own DB? How do I access it?
